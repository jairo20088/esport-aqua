            Team Aqua is an upcoming eSports team based in Cura√ßao Our main goal
            is to help find talented players and open opportunities for them.
            Our community is the most important aspect of the team. The amount
            of support that were recently receiving is tremendous and is a
            stimulant for us to keep working harder on the team. We organize
            scrims and tournaments on a weekly basis so we can promote hidden
            talent and give back to the community.
